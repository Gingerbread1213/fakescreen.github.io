This PWA (Progressive Web Application) is a WIP.

Ever since my 126th commit (very specific) I have added the ability to change your phone name!
The app is now usable for anyone (after it's finished, obviously)

If you would like to try it now, here you go:

============================== INSTALLATION ==============================
1. Click/copy and paste this link: https://kamnivas.github.io/ScreenTimeFaker
2. Add the webpage to home screen
    If you do not already know how to do this, here you go (2 tutorials in 1!):
    - Press share (rectangle with an arrow pointing up)
    - Scroll down to find "Add to Home Screen"
    - Give it a name like "Settings" if you'd like to confuse your parents, the icon is already the settings icon
3. If you kept the name as ScreenTimeFaker, you should probably hide it somewhere (optional but highly reccomended)

============================== USAGE INSTRUCTIONS ==============================
So far, you can change the following:
- Phone Name
- Daily Usage

========== HOW TO CHANGE DATA ==========
Triple-Click the secret button to access the Add/Edit Usage Page
- The secret button is exactly at the bottom where "Turn Off App and Website Activity is"
- You have 500 Miliseconds (half a second) to click it 3 times
- You will then be brought to the Add/Edit Usage page
- You can edit your usage here, but you can also edit your phone name
- Usage is in minutes (eg. Sunday: 60 means you used 1 hr on Sunday)

========== THIS APP IS NOT STUPID PROOF ==========
Edit to your heart's desire, but there are a few things that I wouldn't reccomend doing
1. Negative minutes
    - This will not result in a crash, but it will only result in it counting as 0, or nonexistent
    - You're also wasting your time doing this
2. More than 24 hours
    - Yes, also ok for memes, but that wasn't this app's intention
    - This will also not result in a crash, but the bar will be extended very high up
3. Really long phone name
    - Please keep the phone name to your name, and then iPhone, that would fit the best
    - eg. Kamnivas's iPhone

==================== TROUBLESHOOTING ====================
I have run into a few issues myself. I will update this list with fixes as needed
1. Data is not saving
    Make sure you have enough storage quota, you can do this by...
    - Go to settings and find Safari
    - Scroll all the way down to Advanced
    - At the very top, click website data
    - Swipe left to delete data for websites
    - You can also scroll all the way down for the option to clear all website data
    This worked for me, I think it's worth a shot, then I realized how much website data I had

Feel free to DM me and thank me on Discord: kamnivas
(Please mention something about ScreenTimeFaker so that I know you didn't make a username typo)
